         <h1>Description</h1>
      
         <p>This butter chicken recipe features a full flavored sauce that complements the chicken well</p>
      <p>It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne</p>

       <h1>Ingredients</h1>
       <ul>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</ul>
       <ul>1 shallot, finely chopped</ul>
       <ul>¼ white onion, chopped</ul>
       <ul>2 tablespoons butter</ul>
       <ul>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</ul>
       <ul>2 teaspoons lemon juice</ul>
       <ul>2 teaspoons garam masala, divided</ul>
       <ul>1 teaspoon chili powder</ul>
       <ul>1 teaspoon ground cumin</ul>
       <ul>1 bay leaf</ul>
       <ul>1 cup tomato puree</ul>
       <ul>1 cup half-and-half</ul>
       <ul>¼ cup plain yogurt</ul>
       <ul>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>
       <ul>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</ul>
       <ul>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</ul>
       <ul>1 tablespoon cornstarch</ul>
       <ul>¼ cup water</ul>

       <h1>Steps</h1>
       <ol>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</ol>
       <ol>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</ol>
       <ol>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</ol>
       <ol>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</ol>
       <ol>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</ol>
       <ol>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</ol>
       <ol>Serve over rice with naan.</ol>
